Wow, the %s party finally won an election! Between you and me, 
we are not interested in making the lives of our residents easier. 
We can use our power and influence to enrich ourselves and our donors at the expense of every day %s-ians. 
At the end of our term, we probably will have lost some votes due to all the bad things we like to do.
%s houses convince their neighbors to votes for our opponents,
but %s houses will convince their neighbors to vote for us.
We can use our TV network and mail out flyers to boost our influence,
but we can only gain a majority if we are not doing bad things.
%s always draw the districts fairly.
See if you can draw them so that we win, even with a minority.

It's our turn to show the people how good the %s party can be for everyday %s-ians.
The %ss always draw the districts unfairly. We like to draw them fairly,
