In Gerrymandered! you play as the Evil political party. Every day you are in office, your popularity goes down (because of all the bad things you are doing), all the while, the Good party gains popularity.

The Good party always draws their district fairly. When they are in power, you need the popular vote to win. While you can't do your evil stuff when they are in charge, you CAN make it sound like they are doing bad things. Clicking the "propaganda" button makes your popularity go up and theirs go down.

How many election cycles can you last? Draw the districts so your party wins, even when you are the least popular!

There are n districts, which must all be equal in number of houses. The area is thus district.size / n. All districts must be connected to eachother.

Greater pressure on the touchscreen covers a greater area. (Add this once the tech gets invented lol :))

The district is made up of *thousands of houses. Each house influences the ones around it. Propaganda makes the Evil party more influential. Being in power makes the Evil party lose influence.

Each red house has n probabilty of influencing each neighboring blue house.
